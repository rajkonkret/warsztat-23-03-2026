"""Add dunder methods based on the fields defined in the class.

    Examines PEP 526 __annotations__ to determine fields.

    If init is true, an __init__() method is added to the class. If repr
    is true, a __repr__() method is added. If order is true, rich
    comparison dunder methods are added. If unsafe_hash is true, a
    __hash__() method is added. If frozen is true, fields may not be
    assigned to after instance creation. If match_args is true, the
    __match_args__ tuple is added. If kw_only is true, then by default
    all fields are keyword-only. If slots is true, a new class with a
    __slots__ attribute is returned.
